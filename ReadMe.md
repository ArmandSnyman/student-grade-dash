PROBLEM STATEMENT
To properly intervene before it is too late, educational institutions frequently struggle to identify pupils who are likely to perform poorly academically. It is necessary to have a trustworthy system that can anticipate academic results by analysing a variety of characteristics, including demographics, study habits, parental participation, and extracurricular activities. As a result, schools will be able to put customised plans into place to help kids, boost output, and increase overall academic achievement.

HYPOTHESIS GENERATION 
Gender and Academic Performance: Gender differences significantly affect students’ GPA.
Study Hours and GPA: Students who dedicate more time to studying tend to achieve higher GPAs.
Parental Education and Support: Higher parental education levels and greater parental support positively influence student academic outcomes.
Extracurricular activities and Grades: Participation in extracurricular activities is associated with improved academic performance.
Attendance and GPA: Students with better school attendance records achieve higher GPAs compared to those with frequent absences.
