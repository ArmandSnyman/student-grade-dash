Problem Statement

BrightPath Academy aims to empower students through personalized education and early academic interventions. However, the school faces challenges in identifying at-risk students promptly, providing targeted support, understanding the impact of extracurricular activities on academic performance, and translating data into actionable insights. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using the Student_performance_data dataset to classify students' academic performance (GradeClass) based on demographics, study habits, parental involvement, and extracurricular activities. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, the model will enable early identification of students at risk of poor academic performance, recommend tailored interventions, and provide insights into the factors influencing student success.

Hypothesis Generation

Students who dedicate more weekly study time are more likely to achieve higher GradeClass categories compared to those with less study time.
Higher levels of parental support are positively correlated with better academic performance.
Students participating in extracurricular activities have higher GPAs and better GradeClass outcomes due to improved time management and holistic development.
Frequent absences negatively impact academic performance, leading to lower GPAs and poorer GradeClass categories.
Students receiving tutoring are more likely to achieve better GradeClass outcomes than those without tutoring.
Demographic factors such as gender and ethnicity influence academic performance, with potential variations in GradeClass distribution across these groups.
Students whose parents have higher education levels are more likely to achieve higher GradeClass categories due to increased academic support and resources at home.
The combination of study habits, parental involvement, and extracurricular participation has a stronger predictive power for GradeClass than any single factor alone.

These hypotheses will guide in the model-building phases to uncover patterns and validate assumptions about factors affecting student performance.
